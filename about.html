                Pinky's Cupcake Palace was founded in 2017 by <strong>Penelope "Pinky" Smith</strong>, a lifelong baker with a dream to share joy one cupcake at a time. Starting in her home kitchen with just a handful of recipes and a lot of love, Pinky began selling her sweet creations at local farmers' markets and school events.

                Word quickly spread, and soon her cupcakes became a community favorite. In 2020, she opened her first storefront, and Pinky's Cupcake Palace was born. Today, the bakery is known for its playful flavors, creative designs, and warm, welcoming atmosphere.
